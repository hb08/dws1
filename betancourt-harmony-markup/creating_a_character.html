		<h1>So you'd like to play in Claremont...</h1>
		<p>Hello, and welcome to our game! After having explored the website, you have decided to join the game. There are a few steps you'll want to follow before submitting a character for play.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Read all the character bios. <i>This will allow you to see what we are looking for in an application, and what we already have.</i></li>
			<li>Submit a character concept. <i>We always advise contacting us with a base concept idea. Some ideas we may not like off the bat. Others could step on the toes of characters already in play. We are always willing to work with you, and this is a great way to narrow down your options before investing too much time.</i></li>
			<li>Create your character bio. <i>Please use the application on our site</i></li>
			<li>Submit the bio to the admin.</li>
			<li>Wait for a response and make any changes necessary. <i>Please keep in mind that the admin are all currently students at a university level, have families, and may even enjoy activities that don't involve the internet. We will get to your bio <abbr title="As Soon As Possible"">ASAP</abbr>. The usual wait time from bio submission to first response is 1-7 days. If you haven't received a response within a week, please let us know.</i></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>The Approval Process</h2>
		<p> The approval process should never be a mystery. Once a bio is submitted, the approval team will review it. We are looking for a consistant theme for the character, a logical powerset, a history that makes sense, and for something unique.</p>
		<p> Once we have reviewed the bio, we will contact you with any changes that need to be made, and any questions we may have. Please, <strong>do not get discouraged</strong>! Everyone goes through the same process, and we really do want you to play in our game. By maintaining a need for quality, even if it means a lower quantity of players, we have been able to keep our game alive for six years without a single reboot.</p>
		<em>Before submission, please check for the following!</em>
		<p>We are not looking for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Common Characters.</strong> A surly man with a fondness for cigars, regeneration, and weapons that protrude from his body at will, or a girl with red hair, a nasty temper, loved by everyone, and control over fire, have not only been done on a very well-known and famous example, but also can be found in every single super hero based game on the planet. Please, be original!</li>
			<li><strong>What We've Got.</strong> We have all of our current characters up for anyone to view at any time. Please do not use a power set, personality, or unique history we already have. Remember, there can only be a finite amount of people from abusive homes with destructive powers who are bristly on the outside but secretly very sweet. In fact, we see no need for more than one of those characters in a game. Some histories we will give leeway to, such as an average American family. There is a reason it is called average, after all!</li>
			<li><strong>Mary Sues and Marty Stus!</strong> While no one will ever admit to creating a Mary Sue or Marty Stu, it happens even to the best of us. If you have no idea what either of those mean, please take a look at <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Tv Tropes</a>. There are a lot of great examples and even some links to a test you can take to double check that you aren't wandering into such dreaded country.</li>
		</ul>
